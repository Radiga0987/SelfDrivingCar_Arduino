# SelfDrivingCar_Arduino
Using an Arduino Uno and a motor driver(L239D) and some libraries in Arduino, I have coded a self driving object detecting car that uses ultrasonic sensors to determine object distances when paired with a servo motor.

### Parts used:
1) Arduino UNO
2) Ultrasonic range finder module (REES52)
3) Motor driver (L239D)
4) Servo motor
5) Motors (x4)
6) Sliding switch (1 or 2 based on requirement and usage)
7) LED (1 to 2)
8) Rechargeable Li-ion batteries (x2, 3.7 Volts)
9) Wheels (x4)
10) Wood base
